Have you ever wondered how the stock market works? Does the idea of buying and selling shares seem confusing? 
Well, fear not my friends, for we have brought to you the never-been-done-before stock market simulation to answer all your questions!

In this simulation game, players go to our website, LitCoin, https://litcoin.herokuapp.com/ and instantly get to experience how
stocks and stuff works. We *tried* to implement socket.io to allow multiple players to log in and allow realtime changes to be made. But for now we just have a lot of Javascript code. 


Team Name: Tuples1
Contains: Joseph Lu - the Soylent hoarder
          Shabana Dhayananth - the html pro
          Suhavi Sandhu - the pusher and puller of all gits everywhere
